## Description
This is a notepad-like app and a note taking app combined together, built with Java and Java swing for the GUI. You can save text whether to external text files where you specify the directory and file name, or save the note with a button click "Save Note" that saves the file and you can open all saved files from inside the app by clicking the "Saved Notes" button to open the side window which will show a reference to all saved notes.
